  Three member replica sets provide enough redundancy to survive most network partitions and other system failures. 
  These sets also have sufficient capacity for many distributed read operations. 
  Replica sets should always have an odd number of members. 
  This ensures that elections will proceed smoothly. For more about designing replica sets, see the [Replication overview](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/).
